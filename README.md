# Basic CLI

A basic CLI made using the Clap library in Rust.

## Installation
This CLI can only be installed by directly compiling the binary on your machine. To do this, you'll first need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Once you've cloned the repository, execute this command within the directory:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage
```bash
basic-cli greet Name
```

This is a basic program, so this is the only command that you can execute. You will be greeted like: "Hello, name".
